# twitch_spam_detector (work in progress)

Detects people spamming WeirdChamp, a third party twitch emote that makes chat feel toxic.
I do not like when people spam WeirdChamp in chat, it looks aggressive and makes reading chat very not fun! So I thought I'd start blocking the two or three people who spam the chat constantly with that emote.

The problem:
In big streamer channels, chat is too fast to go back and see the user that spammed the emote

So I decided to make this script to detect and store in a database people who spammed the emote.



To run: `node index.js`
You also need to edit the strings.js file to your login info
